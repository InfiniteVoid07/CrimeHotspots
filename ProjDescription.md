# CrimeHotspots
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model to predict crime hotspots. The model will be trained on historical crime data, as well as other relevant data sources such as social media data, taxi trip data, and point-of-interest data. The model will be used to identify areas with a high likelihood of crime, which can then be targeted with crime prevention measures.
