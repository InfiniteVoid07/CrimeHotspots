# CrimeHotspots

**Project Title:** - "Saavdhaan - Crime Hotspot Detection"

**Project Description:**

Crime hotspot prediction is the process of identifying areas with a high concentration of crime. It is a valuable tool for law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and the public. By predicting where crime is most likely to occur, resources can be allocated more efficiently and effectively, and people can be more aware of their surroundings and take steps to protect themselves.
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model to predict crime hotspots. The model will be trained on historical crime data, as well as other relevant data sources such as social media data, taxi trip data, and point-of-interest data. The model will be used to identify areas with a high likelihood of crime, which can then be targeted with crime prevention measures.

**Project Goals:**

1) Develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict crime hotspots.
2) Make the model available to law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and the public so that it can be used to improve public safety and reduce crime.
3) Generate revenue from the model by charging businesses a subscription fee to use it.

**Project Timeline:**

-> Phase 1: Data collection and preparation. This phase will involve collecting and cleaning historical crime data, as well as other relevant data sources.
-> Phase 2: Model development and evaluation. This phase will involve developing and evaluating different machine-learning models to predict crime hotspots.
-> Phase 3: Model deployment and commercialization. This phase will involve deploying the model to production and making it available to law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and the public.

**Project Implementation:**

- Use clear and concise labels, icons, and graphics to convey information effectively. Colour code different Crimes based on their severity.
- Implement geofencing functionality to trigger alerts when users enter or leave crime hotspots.
- Provide users with options to report crimes and contact local authorities.
- Display crime information, safety tips, and resources related to the specific crime hotspot.
